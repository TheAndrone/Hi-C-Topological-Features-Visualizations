# Hi-C-Topological-Features-Visualizations
Here are the ready-to-use visualizations for the Visualisation and exploration tools for chromatin networks project.
## Visualizations directory 
It should be copied to a local computer. It contains everything for the tool to work! See readme in the Visualizations directory.
## Validation directory 
I has all modules that are used to transform the Hi-C data from public databases to a format that is used in the visualization. Those modules can be used to adapt user's own data to a format that is used in our tool.
